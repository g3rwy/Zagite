# Zagite
was supposed to be **Zig**ate, since you know, Zig and gates, but well.


## Building
  For now its literally just `zig build install` but i will provide more options in future. Should work on all Platforms that raylib/zig supports, since i   don't add anything platform specific *yet*.
  

## Requirements
  - Zig 0.10.0-dev
  - Raylib 4.2-dev
